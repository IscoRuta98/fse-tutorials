### Creating a React App

Prior to February 2025, you could simply create a React project by running

```node
npx create-react-app about-me-react-app
```

Although this is possible, this method of Creating a React App (CRA) has been deprecated.

### Creating a React App using Vite

Vite is a modern build tool that provides a fast and optimized development experience for web applications. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, offering instant server start, lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized builds.

To create a React app using Vite, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to scaffold a new React project:

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
    ```

    Replace `my-react-app` with the desired name of your project.

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-react-app
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Vite has become a popular choice for creating React apps due to its simplicity, speed, and modern features that enhance the developer experience.
